# Java-Calculator
In order to further practice my Java, I made a multifunctional calculator program. Simple, but functional.

It has three main programs:

1. Simple Calculator:
  Offers the basic calculations using two integer inputs and one of the four base mathematical operators.
  
2. Zakat Calculator:
  This is a calculator for Zakat (mandatory Muslim tax), nothing speacial in version 1.0 but I plan to add some complexity and more optiuons to in soon.
  
3. Currency Converter:
  As the name suggests, this function is used to convert Pakistani Rupees to US Dollars and vice versa. Down the road, as my Java improves, I'll try to use APIs (or a better suited tool) to call live exchange rates and offer  more currencies to convert to or from.
